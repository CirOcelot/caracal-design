## Milestone1
 Good work on Milestone1. The scope of work you outlined in your Purpose, Audience, and Goal matches the guidelines in the project specifications. Your persona highlights your target demographic, and you only have one small error in your HTML.
### Edits and Suggestions
 __"You entirely skipped the persona's frustrations, goals, additional information, and User Story"__.  
  I wish you had read the directions I left for you. I specifically asked for a goals section in your persona which you failed to add.
	 None of the instructions for PWP mention a use-case or interaction flow for Milestone1. Use-cases and interaction flows are used to highlight how an end user Interacts with a  complex dynamic site. The site you will be creating for PWP will be a straightforward static website.
 	You resubmitted  Milestone1 without asking for any clarifications or feedback. I would have been happy to sit down and evaluate the changes you made and talk to you about what you had done well and what might need improvement.  
	Being able to ask for feedback, pay attention to details, and following written instructions are important skills that every developer should master.
### Grade TierII

### Milestone 2a Feedback
Good work on wireframes and accompanying content strategy - your design ideas are clear and defined. This will help in the next phase of development.

Be careful with the staggered layout here on mobile. You might want to stack these items on the smallest screens to ensure there is enough space to comfortably read the text - the horizontal space might get too narrow, so stagger only on screen sizes that can accommodate it well.

Additional recommendations:
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for custom typography - it has ~1000 fonts and is easy to integrate.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a good quality free library for including iconography.

Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are now clear to begin development on your PWP. Solid improvement on work from Milestone 1. Good job!

### Final Grade
Awesome job your PWP. Your site is polished and I can tell you spent alot of time on it. However you do have a few flaws I want to point out. First, I think it is best you remove the place holder cards you have in the project section. Second I had no idea your contact form worked because you did not have a success message on the page.
