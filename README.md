## Milestone1
 Good work on Milestone1. The scope of work you outlined in your Purpose, Audience, and Goal matches the guidelines in the project specifications. Your persona highlights your target demographic, and you only have one small error in your HTML.
### Edits and Suggestions
 __"You entirely skipped the persona's frustrations, goals, additional information, and User Story"__.  
  I wish you had read the directions I left for you. I specifically asked for a goals section in your persona which you failed to add.
	 None of the instructions for PWP mention a use-case or interaction flow for Milestone1. Use-cases and interaction flows are used to highlight how an end user Interacts with a  complex dynamic site. The site you will be creating for PWP will be a straightforward static website.
 	You resubmitted  Milestone1 without asking for any clarifications or feedback. I would have been happy to sit down and evaluate the changes you made and talk to you about what you had done well and what might need improvement.  
	Being able to ask for feedback, pay attention to details, and following written instructions are important skills that every developer should master.
