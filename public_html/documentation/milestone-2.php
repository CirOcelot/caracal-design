		<p><h2>This will be a one-page site, and will have these sections: </h2></p>
		<h3>Welcome: </h3>Splash page displays my name as well as my company's name below. These will be overlaid on a
		large jumbotron with a transitioning image.
		<p>
			<h3>Mission Statement:</h3> This section will give a brief description of what my professional goals are, and
		will show the standards to which I hold myself and my company. There will be a professional tone, to attract
		clients in a work environment, and convey my tone when handling work.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Past work: </h3> This section will have thumbnail images of past sites/work that I want highlighted. There will
		 be a few (3-4) sites showcased, with short descriptions to the side of each thumbnail. The thumbnails will be links as
		well, so interested parties can visit sites that I've made in the past quickly and conveniently.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Contact us: </h3> This section will have a simple form to fill out that will put the user in contact with me.
		It will also display my professional email and phone number, should they wish to contact me through those avenues.
		I will also have links to my professional social media, such as linkedIn and GitHub.
