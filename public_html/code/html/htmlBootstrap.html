Human give me attention meow pee in the shoe you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me purr for attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently. Dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain sit on human i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun. Hide at bottom of staircase to trip human my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor purr for no reason need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human,</span>

<img src="" alt=""><span>Love you, then bite you ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside, lick butt and make a weird face claw drapes, for crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened, spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Purr prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the neighbor's dog and make it bark, sit and stare. Climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken! but stare at imaginary bug. My water bowl is clean and freshly replenished,</span>
